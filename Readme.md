The framework used has been implemented and created by Harald Scheidl to correctly recognize english handwritten words in IAM dataset.
I have created a basic dataset for Tankri(Indic Script) using handwritten samples and segmenting them.The model when trained on said samples performes well.
More samples can be created using joiner.py in src folder.
The Tankri Font is included.
